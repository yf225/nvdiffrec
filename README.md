Joint optimization of topology, materials and lighting from multi-view image observations 
as described in the paper
[Extracting Triangular 3D Models, Materials, and Lighting From Images](https://nvlabs.github.io/nvdiffrec/).

For differentiable marching tetrahedons, we have adapted code from NVIDIA's [Kaolin: A Pytorch Library for Accelerating 3D Deep Learning Research](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin).

# Installation

Requires Python 3.6+, VS2019+, Cuda 11.3+ and PyTorch 1.10+

Tested in Anaconda3 with Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.10

## One time setup (Windows)

Install the [Cuda toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (required to build the PyTorch extensions).
We support Cuda 11.3 and above.
Pick the appropriate version of PyTorch compatible with the installed Cuda toolkit.
Below is an example with Cuda 11.6

```
conda create -y -n dmodel python=3.9
conda activate dmodel
conda install -y pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install ninja imageio PyOpenGL glfw xatlas gdown
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast/
pip install --global-option="--no-networks" git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn#subdirectory=bindings/torch
imageio_download_bin freeimage
```

### Every new command prompt
`conda activate dmodel`

# Examples

*Our approach is designed for high-end NVIDIA GPUs with large amounts of memory.
To run on mid-range GPU's, reduce the batch size parameter in the .json files.*

Simple genus 1 reconstruction example:
```
python train.py --config configs/bob.json
```
Visualize training progress (only supported on Windows):
```
python train.py --config configs/bob.json --display-interval 20
```

Multi GPU example (Linux only. *Experimental: all results in the paper were generated using a single GPU*),
using [PyTorch DDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html#launcher-api)
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train.py --config configs/bob.json
```

Below, we show the starting point and the final result. References to the right.

![Initial guess](images/start_of_training.jpg "Intial guess")
![Our result](images/end_of_training.jpg "Our result")

The results will be stored in the `out` folder.
The [Spot](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/index.html#spot) and
[Bob](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/index.html) models were
created and released into the public domain by [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/index.html).

Included examples

- `spot.json` - Extracting a 3D model of the spot model. Geometry, materials, and lighting from image observations.
- `spot_fixlight.json` - Same as above but assuming known environment lighting.
- `spot_metal.json` - Example of joint learning of materials and high frequency environment lighting to showcase split-sum.
- `bob.json` - Simple example of a genus 1 model.

# Datasets

We additionally include configs (`nerf_*.json`, `nerd_*.json`) to reproduce the main results of the paper. We rely on third party datasets, which
are courtesy of their respective authors. Please note
that individual licenses apply to each dataset. To automatically download and pre-process all datasets, run the 
`download_datasets.py` script:
```
conda activate dmodel
cd data
python download_datasets.py
```
Below follows more information and instructions on how to manually install the datasets (in case the automated script fails).

**NeRF synthetic dataset** Our view interpolation results use the synthetic dataset from the original [NeRF](https://github.com/bmild/nerf) paper.
To manually install it, download the [NeRF synthetic dataset archive](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=18JxhpWD-4ZmuFKLzKlAw-w5PpzZxXOcG)
and unzip it into the `nvdiffrec/data` folder. This is required for running any of the `nerf_*.json` configs.

**NeRD dataset** We use datasets from the [NeRD](https://markboss.me/publication/2021-nerd/) paper, which features real-world photogrammetry and inaccurate
(manually annotated) segmentation masks. Clone the NeRD datasets using git and rescale them to 512 x 512 pixels resolution using the script
`scale_images.py`. This is required for running any of the `nerd_*.json` configs.
```
conda activate dmodel
cd nvdiffrec/data/nerd
git clone https://github.com/vork/ethiopianHead.git
git clone https://github.com/vork/moldGoldCape.git
python scale_images.py
```

# Server usage (through Docker)

- Build docker image.
```
cd docker
bash ./make_image.sh nvdiffrec:v1
```

- Start an interactive docker container:
`docker run --gpus device=0 -it --rm -v /raid:/raid -it nvdiffrec:v1 bash`

- Detached docker:
`docker run --gpus device=1 -d -v /raid:/raid -w=[path to the code] nvdiffrec:v1 python train.py --config configs/bob.json`
